# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2020 Submissions ðŸŽ„
Use this repo to "submit" your answers for the Advent of Code 2020 Challenges. You can also look at other students submissions if you are stuck or want to see how others solved the challenge. **I strongly recomend you don't look at answers before trying the challenge for yourself**

## Challenges
You can find the daily challenges on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2020). They can be completed in any language you prefer, if you are new to programming we reccomend using Python 3 or JavaScript.

## Submitting
In order to submit your answers to this repository you will need to:

1. Fork this repository to "make a copy" in your Github Account.
2. In your fork [or copy] add folder named after you (first names or pseudonyms only!) with your submissions inside.
3. Stage and commit those changes to your copy of the repo, use good commit messages!
3. Make a new pull request to have your code be merged into this repository.

You can submit daily or save up a few and submit multiple at a time.
